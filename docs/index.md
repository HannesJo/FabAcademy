This is where I'm going to document the preparation work in advance to the FabAcademy 2025. 

I'm going to report on the following topics: 

+ [Setting up this homepage](/docs/pre-fab/homepage.md)

+ [Milling with the ShopBot using VCarve](/docs/pre-fab/milling.md)

+ [Creating a PCB](/docs/pre-fab/pcb.md)
